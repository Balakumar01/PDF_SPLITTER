The PDF Splitter App is a browser-based tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to split PDF files into smaller files based on custom page ranges. The app automatically keeps the original filename and adds the selected page range for clarity. For example, splitting my_document.pdf between pages 1–2 generates my_document_1_2.pdf.
